## This is the current release build of the PMU Connection Tester, version 4.5.5

This version of the connection tester was released with openPDC 2.0, version 166.

* Changes since 4.5.4:*

Corrected issue with SEL Fast Message to ignore duplicate 0xFF values in streaming data that can occur with data transmission over Ethernet when Telnet protocol is being used.

** This application requires that [.NET 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) already be installed on your system. **

* Note this release of the PMU Connection Tester is built on .NET 4.5 using the [Grid Solutions Framework (GSF)](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/gsf). If you want to use or browse protocol source code, please download the [GSF source code|](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/gsf). and look for the GSF.PhasorProtocols project.*

Thanks!
