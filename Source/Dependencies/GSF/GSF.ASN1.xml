                ITU-T X.691. 22.
                NOTE – (Tutorial) A choice type is encoded by encoding an index specifying
                the chosen alternative. This is encoded as for a constrained integer
                (unless the extension marker is present in the choice type,
                in which case it is a normally small non-negative whole number)
                and would therefore typically occupy a fixed length bit-field of the
                minimum number of bits needed to encode the index. (Although it could
                in principle be arbitrarily large.) This is followed by the encoding
                of the chosen alternative, with alternatives that are extension
                additions encoded as if they were the value of an open type field.
                Where the choice has only one alternative, there is no encoding
                for the index.

            This class implements an output stream in which the data is written
            into a reverse byte array. The buffer automatically grows as data is
            written to it. The data can be retrieved using <code>toByteArray()</code>
            and <code>toString()</code>. Closing a <tt>ByteArrayOutputStream</tt>
            has no effect. The methods in this class can be called after the stream
            has been closed without generating an <tt>IOException</tt>.
