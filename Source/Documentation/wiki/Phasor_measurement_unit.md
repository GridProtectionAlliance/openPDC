# Phasor Measurement Unit

## Description

> A ***phasor measurement unit*** (PMU) is a device which measures the electrical waves on an electricity grid using a common time source for synchronization. Time synchronization allows synchronized real-time measurements of multiple remote measurement points on the grid. The resulting measurement is known as a ***synchrophasor***. PMUs are considered to be one of the most important measuring devices in the future of power systems.
