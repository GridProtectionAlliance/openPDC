## The openPDC Manager

The Silverlight based openPDC Manager allows consumers to remotely configure anad manage multiple deployed instances of the openPDC from a single simple to use web application. This application is used to manage and configure system devices, custom system input, action and output adapters as well as to set operational parameters. It also allows for automated device configuration using an XML configuration file captured using connection tester.

## The System Configuration Editor</h2>

The openPDC system configuration editor allows users to modify low-level system settings that are stored in the configuration file from a simple to use GUI based application. These settings are typically only updated when fundamental changes are being made to how the openPDC operates.
