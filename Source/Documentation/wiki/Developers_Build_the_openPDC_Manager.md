## Installation

### Building from source code

In order to build the openPDC Manager, you will need to follow the steps for building the openPDC described on the [Developers Getting Started](Developers_Getting_Started.md) page. Additionally, you will also need to install both of the following.

- [Silverlight 3 Tools for Visual Studio 2008 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9442b0f2-7465-417a-88f3-5e7b5409e9dd&displaylang=en)
- [Silverlight 3 Toolkit July 2009](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=24246)

Now follow these steps to rebuild the Synchrophasor solution.

1. Navigate to `SOURCEDIR\Synchrophasor\Current Version\Source` (SOURCEDIR is the directory where you extracted the openPDC source code).
2. Double-click the file "Synchrophasor.sln"
3. In the Visual Studio toolbar, go to "Build > Rebuild Solution"
