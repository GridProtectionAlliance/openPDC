# Using a Gateway Style Connection Between openPDCs and for openPGs

## How to connect between openPDCs and/or openPGs, in the subscribing system.

1. Navigate to Inputs -> Add New in openPG, or Devices -> Add New in openPDC
2. Enter the acronym you want this device to have
3. Under 'Protocol', select 'Gateway Transport'
4. With the connection string, click the '+', select the UDP tab, and select what local port you wish to use
5. In the Connection String, type 'autoconnect=true'
6. (If using the same database as openPDC) Add 'synchronizeMetaData=false' to connect string
7. In the Alternate Command Channel, type 'server=localhost:6165' (Replace 'localhost' with the host IP if not on the same system)
8. Ensure 'Concentrator' and 'Enabled' checkboxes are checked
9. Click 'Save'

Your connection should now be established! It may take a few moments to complete metadata exchange; refresh the device list to see the newly added devices.
