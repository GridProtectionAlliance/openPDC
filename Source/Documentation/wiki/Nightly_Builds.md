# Nightly Build Links

These are the links to the nightly builds of the openPDC. We do not recommend using these in production as these builds contain the very latest checked-in code from all developers and may not be thoroughly tested.

### Binaries

- [Synchrophasor Binaries](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/NightlyBuilds/openPDC/Beta-VS2012/Synchrophasor.Binaries.zip)

### Installers

*This includes the installers for the PMU Connection Tester*

- [Synchrophasor Installers](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/NightlyBuilds/openPDC/Beta-VS2012/Synchrophasor.Installs.zip)

### Online Documentation

- [Phasor Protocol API Help](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/NightlyBuilds/GridSolutionsFramework/Help/html/N_GSF_PhasorProtocols.htm)

Nightly builds happen at midnight in the Eastern time zone each day so long as there was a code change checked into the solution that day.
