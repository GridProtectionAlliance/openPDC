### Release Notes

[![](files/project_icon_lrg.gif)]() This is the August 2010 release build of the openPDC, version 1.2.40

Note that this version of the openPDC has been upgraded to work with .NET 4.0. Make sure your system has .NET 4.0 before installation:

[Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&amp;displaylang=en)

[See our YouTube video for quick installation of the openPDC August 2010 Release](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmuQD3dluxM")

The August release has three improvement focus areas:

* Performance
* Stability
* Simplicity

A multitude of performance and stability enhancements are included with this release - see the deep [change log](http://openpdc.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets) for details. Additional performance and stability benefits, including fundamental multi-threading improvements, come from the upgrade to .NET 4.0.

Simplicity was targeted at both ease-of-use in the user interface and easier installation. This version of the openPDC comes with a completely new, tightly integrated GUI based version of the openPDC manager. The GUI manager automatically installs along with the openPDC so no further setup or installation will be required to use the system. The web based openPDC manager is still available for web based deployments where desired, but this is now an optional component and the more complicated IIS installation can be turned over to IT staff.
